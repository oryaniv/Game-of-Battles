why healer and fool so low?


balancing options:

- increase everyone's hp - squishies more viable + more room for skill

super gauge(supers)



A seamless, abstract background texture. It must have NO visible horizontal lines, vertical lines, grid lines, squares, or any geometric patterns whatsoever. The texture should be purely organic, fluid, and blended. The dominant color is a light, earthy brown (#8C785B), reminiscent of dry, cracked ground. It features subtle, organic, and irregular blotches of muted forest green (#4A6D3A) representing scattered moss or low vegetation, blending softly across the surface. Additionally, add very small, irregular, and subtle blotches or specks of light gray (#777777) to represent little stone or rock elements, giving a natural, slightly textured, and abstract aesthetic, similar to an old, weathered landscape or terrain map.
