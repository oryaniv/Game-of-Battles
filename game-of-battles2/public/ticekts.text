A pixel art portrait of the female jester character, "The Fool," from the user's game. The sprite should strictly match the pixel art style and level of detail of the existing combatant sprites, but focused on her head and upper torso.
    Her head should be drawn at a 45-degree angle, with her winking eye (e.g., her right eye) further from the viewer, and her open eye (e.g., her left eye) closer to the viewer, making it more prominent.
    She is smiling mischievously and winking with the eye further from the viewer.
    Crucially, her open eye (the one closer to the viewer) must have a distinct, clearly visible "hex symbol inside a circle" drawn as makeup around it, replacing the usual black circle. This symbol should be precise and well-defined.
    Her face is covered in white pixelated makeup. Her hair is split blonde/black. The overall feel should be whimsical, mischievous, and slightly eerie. The sprite should be isolated on a transparent background, approximately 64x64 pixels in resolution, rendered in crisp pixel art with no anti-aliasing artifacts.
